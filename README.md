This project contains four files:
- Read_me.md
- tidy.txt
- codeBook.md
- run_analysis.R

The run_analysis code does the following things:
- It loads the data and the features and activity codes
- It prepares the data to extract the mean, STD and adding the features
- It merges the data sets of the train and test data
- It adds the names of the columns and labels of activities
- And finally it creates a tidy data set with the means and standard deviations per activity per subject
